# Full Cycle - Golang Challenge

That is the result of the challenge I had to do after finishing all the `Docker` module classes in the Full Cycle course.

There are two ways to see the result:

1. Using the docker image I put on docker hub: [`vitorleonel/fullcycle-challenge-golang`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/vitorleonel/fullcycle-challenge-golang);
2. Clone this repository and build locally.

It doesn't matter which way you choos,e but the result in your terminal needs to be `Code.education Rocks!`.
